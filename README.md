The primary aim of this project is to assess data quality limitations of the most comprehensive set of biological records for terrestrial Antarctica. The recent release of the SCAR Antarctic Terrestrial Biodiversity Database offers unprecedented opportunities for modelling biodiversity over the continent, however models must be built with regard to existing limitations.

The project aims, methods, results, and discussion are presented in our paper entitled: "How biased and uncertain is our knowledge of Antarctic Terrestrial Biodiversity?" (In Review). Patterson C.R., K. J. Helmstedt, A. Terauds and J. Shaw.

Please see Terauds et al. (2023) for a description of the database and its construction.

The data/code presented here includes:
- Terrestrial_Antarctic_Biodiversity_Database_Cleaning.html: R Markdown document of database cleaning prior to analysis.
- Geographic_Coverage.html : R Markdown document of geographic coverage analysis.
- Temporal_Coverage.html : R Markdown document of temporal coverage analysis.
- Taxonomic_Coverage.html : R Markdown document of taxonomic coverage analysis.
- Uncertainty.html : R Markdown document of geographic, taxonomic, temporal, and combined uncertainty analysis.
