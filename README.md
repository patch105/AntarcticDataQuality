The primary aim of this project is to assess the data quality of the most comprehensive set of biological records ever available for terrestrial Antarctica, the SCAR Antarctic Terrestrial Biodiversity Database. The database offers unprecedented opportunities for modelling biodiversity across the continent, however models must be built with regard to existing limitations.

The project aims, methods, results, and discussion are presented in our paper entitled: "A multidimensional assessment of Antarctic terrestrial biological data" (In Review). Patterson C.R., K.J. Helmstedt, A. Terauds and J.D. Shaw.

Please see Terauds et al. (In Review) for a description of the database and its construction.

The data/code presented here includes:
- Terrestrial_Antarctic_Biodiversity_Database_Cleaning.html: R Markdown document of database cleaning prior to analysis.
- Geographic_Coverage.html : R Markdown document of geographic coverage analysis.
- Temporal_Coverage.html : R Markdown document of temporal coverage analysis.
- Taxonomic_Coverage.html : R Markdown document of taxonomic coverage analysis.
- Environmental_Coverage.html : R Markdown document of environmental coverage analysis.
